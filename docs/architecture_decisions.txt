# **Architecture Design Decisions**

 **Modules:**

1. Person Microservice (person-api) : exposes REST APIs for handling data related to a person. It also produces data for person topic and sends data to connection-api via gRPC. 
2. Location Microservice (location): exposes REST APIs for fetching and creating location. It also produces data for location topic.
3. Consumers: defines the consumers for person and location topic. It can scale independently.
4. Connection Microservice (connection-api) :
	- recieves connection data from person-api.
	- implements internal API to handle geolocation data for the App.
	- recieves small payloads and defines strict message contracts.

**Patterns:**
- gRPC : Gives the ability to process geolocation data concurrently and because the payloads are small and strict, it was the preffered messaging technology choosen.
- Postgres Database : shared database - all microservices share it
